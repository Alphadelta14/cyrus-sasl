<H1>Installation Procedure</H1>

This document offers a general overview of installing the SASL library.

<H2>Quick and Dirty</H2>
<pre>
  cd (directory it was untarred into)
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  ln -s /usr/local/lib/sasl2 /usr/lib/sasl2
</pre>

<p>If you're checking this directly out of CVS, you'll need to run "sh
./SMakefile" to build the configure script first.

<p>Read <A HREF="sysadmin.html">the System Administrator's Guide</A> to
learn how to configure libsasl in depth.  There is also a <A
HREF="upgrading.html">document</A> that covers migrating from libsasl v1
to libsasl v2 applications.

<H2>Details</H2>

<p>Note that the library looks for plugins in <tt>/usr/lib/sasl2</tt>,
but installs them into <tt>${prefix}/lib/sasl2</tt>, where
<tt>${prefix}</tt> is usually something like <tt>/usr/local</tt>.
This is intentional - we want the plugins installed with the rest of
the package (wherever things get installed at your site), but we want
the library to <em>always</em> be able to find its plugins under
<tt>/usr/lib/sasl2</tt>, no matter where you install things, so that
the SASL plugin ABI on all platforms is roughly the same.

<p>If you don't want to do this for some reason, you can set the location
where the library will look for plugins by setting the environment
variable SASL_PATH to the path the library should use.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>You'll probably need the GNU make program, available as of this
writing <a
href=ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/make-3.77.tar.gz>here</a>.<p>

<p>libsasl2 can use gdbm, Berkeley db, or ndbm to implement its
user/password lookup. Most systems come with ndbm these days; as of
this writing, gdbm is available as <a
href=ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdbm/gdbm-1.7.3.tar.gz>this file</a>.
Berkeley DB is available from: <a
href=http://www.sleepycat.com/>here</a>

<p>For Kerberos support, you'll need the kerberos libraries.  At CMU, the
version we use comes from <a href=http://www.pdc.kth.se/kth-krb/>here</a>.

<p>For GSSAPI support you will need either MIT Kerberos 5 or the
<a href=http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal>Heimdal implementation</a>.

<p>You may want to play with your CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS a little if you're
using vendor compilers. We use <tt>gcc</tt> extensively, but you'll
probably have more luck if you use the same compiler for the library
as you do for your applications. You can see what compilers we use on
our platforms by looking at the "SMakefile".

<h3>Supported platforms</h3>

<p>This has been tested under Linux 2.2, Linux 2.4, Solaris 2.7 and
Solaris 2.8.  It should work under any platform where dynamic objects
can be linked against other dynamic objects, and where the dynamic
library file extension is ".so", or where libtool creates the .la
files correctly.

<h2>Installation under Win32</h2>

<B>If you are using SASL under Win32 or have compiled it, please let
us know!</B>

See <a href="windows.html">the Windows documentation</a> for detailed
instructions.
