<H1>Programming with SASL</H1>

Eventually, I hope to expand this into workable documentation for
using the SASL library with various programs.  For now, all I have is
what isn't implemented.  For guidance in using the library, take a
look at the <tt>sample/</tt> directory, and the Cyrus IMAP server
distribution (versions 1.6.0 or later).

<h2>What's not implemented</h2>

Some parts of this API aren't implemented by this implementation.  A
brief outline of these features (and what might come of them) is in
this section.

<h3>Credentials</h3>

None of the modules support passing credentials.  In the future, we
hope to add credential passing to the modules that support it (most
likely the Kerberos modules).  Thus, an application that specifies
<tt>SASL_SEC_PASS_CREDENTIALS</tt> will not receive any mechanisms.
The functions <tt>sasl_cred_install()</tt> and
<tt>sasl_cred_uninstall()</tt> do nothing.

It's likely that the credential API will change, and it's also likely
that you'll need the Cyrus SASL library on both sides of the
connection to make it work.

<h3>Secrets</h3>

<tt>sasl_client_auth()</tt> is unimplemented.  It is unclear what this
is intended for.  If we implement it, it will probably be for
generating secrets for fast reauthentication.

The "<tt>secret</tt>" parameter to <tt>sasl_client_start()</tt> is
unused.  It is likely that we will use this for fast reauthentication.

<h3>Idle</h3>

While the implementation & plugins correctly implement the idle calls,
none of them currently do anything.
