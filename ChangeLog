	* lib/common.c: added default user/authname callbacks

	* Makefile.am: added plugin path warning

1998-11-29  Rob Earhart  <rob+@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* plugins/plain.c: now attempts to look up userid and authid as
 	well as password via callbacks, and sets callback ids
 	appropriately for SASL_INTERACT.  Uses authorization callback.
  	Revamped parser to not copy data onto stack and to use
 	arbitrary-length data.

	* lib/server.c: removed gdbm/ndbm code and the whole SASL_DB_TYPE
 	nonsense; replaced with linkage against _sasl_db_getsecret and
 	_sasl_db_putsecret

	* lib/db_ndbm.c: created; moved ndbm code from server.c to here

	* lib/db_gdbm: created; moved gdbm code from server.c to here

	* lib/db_none: created; filled in hook symbols

	* lib/saslint.h: added _sasl_db_getsecret and _sasl_db_putsecret
 	symbol definitions

	* lib/Makefile.am: added SASL_DB_BACKEND and db backend sources,
 	incremented library version number

	* acconfig.h: removed SASL_DB_TYPE; it's superfluous now

	* configure.in: now subst's SASL_DB_BACKEND appropriately, and is
 	more careful about pulling in libs after checking for them

	* 1.2b2 released
