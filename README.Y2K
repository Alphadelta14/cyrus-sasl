This software has not been tested for Year 2000 compliance.  Carnegie
Mellon University has no plans to test it for Y2K problems; however,
we believe that there should be no problems.  We are interested in the
results should anyone else do Y2K testing; please send us
(cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu) the results of any such tests you do.
