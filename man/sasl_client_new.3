.SH DESCRIPTION

.B sasl_client_new()
creates a new SASL context. This context will be used for all SASL calls for one connection. It handles both authentication and integrity/encyption layers after authentication.
.PP
.I service
is the registered name of the service (usually the protocol name) using SASL (e.g. "imap").
.PP
.I serverFQDN
is the fully qualified domain name of the server (e.g. "serverhost.cmu.edu").
.PP
.I prompt_supp
is a list of client interactions supported that is unique to this connection. If this parameter is NULL the global callbacks (specified in sasl_client_init) will be used. See sasl_callback for more information.
.PP
.I secflags
are security flags (see below)
.PP
.I pconn
is the conection context allocated by the library. This structure will be used for all future SASL calls for this connection.
.PP
.B Security Flags
.PP
Security flags that may be passed to
.B sasl_server_new()
include
.TP 0.8i
.B NOPLAINTEXT
Don't permit mechanisms susceptible to simple passive attack (e.g., PLAIN, LOGIN)
.TP 0.8i
.B NOACTIVE
Protection from active (non-dictionary) attacks during authentication exchange. Authenticates server.
.TP 0.8i
.B NODICTIONARY
Don't permit mechanisms susceptible to passive dictionary attack
.TP 0.8i
.B FORWARD_SECURITY
Require forward secrecy between sessions. (breaking one won't help break next)
.TP 0.8i
.B PASS_CREDENTIALS
Require mechanisms which pass client credentials, and allow mechanisms which can pass credentials to do so.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

sasl_client_new returns an integer which corresponds to one of the
following codes. SASL_OK is the only one that indicates success. All
others indicate errors and should either be handled or the
authentication session should be quit.

.SH ERRORS
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_OK
Success
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_BADVERS
Mechanism version mismatch
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_BADPARAM
error in config file
.TP 0.8i
.B SASL_NOMEM
not enough memory to complete operation
