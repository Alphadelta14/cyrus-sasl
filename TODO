Library
~~~~~~~
) Better/FASTER random numbers (init time is pretty miserable)
) Test suite
) configure stuff: static libs, etc.
) Use libltdl---probably much better portability
  thread problems?  stdio problems?
) parse the .la file instead of assuming we load the ".so" file
) better support for including missing routines
) check return settings (ssf, etc.) on auth failure
) Make real global objects in cram, digest

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
) so much to do here
) how to write an application using sasl (programmer's guide)
) man pages (saslpasswd, individual functions, etc.)
) how to configure sasl (sysadmin guide)
) update INSTALL to have step-by-step instructions

Mechs to write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
) PASSDSS-3DES-1 (draft-newman-sasl-passdss-01.txt)
) OTP

Digest-MD5
~~~~~~~~~~
) Checking wacko cases or even not so wacko cases
) Testing
) correct handling of SASL_SET_CREATE
) allow sending multiple realms from server to client
) reauth?

Kerberos_V4
~~~~~~~~~~~
) client-side should set realm

GSSAPI
~~~~~~
) Allow specification of alternate keytab file?

Plain
~~~~~

Cram-MD5
~~~~~~~~
) needs snprintf support
) correct handling of SASL_SET_CREATE

Database stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
) Flat text file?
) transactions?
) version the database?
) atomic updates of passwords (we can crash and leave the user with 
  different passwords for different mechanisms)

ABI
~~~
) Consider IRIX ABI issues for plugins
	- /usr/lib32/sasl?
	- /usr/lib/sasl/{ABI}?
) Standardize the plugin ABI
