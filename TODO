C
~~~~~~~~~~
) Set username after authenticate (done sometimes already)
) Authorization in kerberos
) Work with our GSSAPI libs
) Use callbacks before trying a SASL_INTERACT
) No buffers on the stack
) No fixed-length buffers
) Zero sensitive data after use
) Better/FASTER random numbers (init time is pretty miserable)
) Test suite

Java
~~~~~~~~~~
) Make libjavasasl link against libsasl dynamically, instead of
  pulling in its objects at link time.
) Things should not be saslFooBar; they should just be fooBar.
  - They already live in package sasl
  - Sun agrees that saslFooBar is annoying to read
) byte[] instead of String.  Everywhere
  - String is immutable, and might be stored forever.  byte[] can be zeroed.
) Callbacks.
) Utility functions for sasl_conn_t manipulation.
) Lots more features -- should be as featureful as the C version.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~
) Rob:
  - About SASL
  - Trivial C server/client
) Karen:
  - Java documentation cleanup?
  - SASL home page

Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~
) PASSDSS-3DES-1 (draft-newman-sasl-passdss-01.txt)
) Digest-MD5 (draft-leach-digest-sasl-00.txt)

ABI
~~~~~~~~~~
) Consider IRIX ABI issues for plugins
	- /usr/lib32/sasl?
	- /usr/lib/sasl/{ABI}?
) Standardize the plugin ABI

Political
~~~~~~~~~~
Release an I-D for the Java SASL stuff.
