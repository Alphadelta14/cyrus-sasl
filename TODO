Library
~~~~~~~
) Better/FASTER random numbers (init time is pretty miserable)
) Test suite
) configure stuff: static libs, etc.
) Use libltdl---probably much better portability
) better support for including missing routines
) atomic updates of passwords (we can crash and leave the user with 
  different passwords for different mechanisms)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
) so much to do here
) how to write an application using sasl (programmer's guide)

Digest-MD5
~~~~~~~~~~
) Layers
) Checking wacko cases or even not so wacko cases
) Testing

) support use of other RC4 libraries

Kerberos_V4

GSSAPI
~~~~~~
) Allow specification of alternate keytab file?

Cram-MD5
~~~~~~~~
) needs snprintf support
) any way to handle realms?
) correct deletion of user account

Database stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
) Berkeley DB?
) Flat text file?

ABI
~~~
) Consider IRIX ABI issues for plugins
	- /usr/lib32/sasl?
	- /usr/lib/sasl/{ABI}?
) Standardize the plugin ABI
