Testing the CMU SASL Library with the included test applications
################################################################

The CMU SASL library comes with two small test programs: sample-client
and sample-server.  Each of these programs dump base-64 SASL iterations
to STDOUT, and read the next iteration from STDIN.  Lines preceded by
"C: " are from the client, and from "S: " are from the server.


Testing anonymous
#################

Run the test server with no args:

% sample-server

In another window, run the test client:

% sample-client -m anonymous

Feed the test client the line of information generated by the test server
This line contains the list of mechanisms the server understands.  This will
cause the client to generate two lines of data.  The first line tells the
server it wants to use the ANONYMOUS mechanism, and the second is the first
iteration of data for the ANONYMOUS transaction.

When these two lines are fed into the server, it will tell you that the
client authenticated as 'anonymous', and send an encrypted string to the client.
(Due to the mechanism in use here, the string isn't really encrypted.)

Sample client output:

Sample server output:


Testing kerberosv4
##################

Run the test server, using the -s arg to set the service ticket to use.

% sample-server

In another window, run the test client, using the following 4 args:

Feed the test client the information generated by the test server, and vice-versa.

After the authentication phase, an encrypted string is sent from the server to
the client.  If you decrypt it correctly, everything worked.

Sample client output:
