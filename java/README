This is a java version of the SASL libraries. It supports all the
mechanisms in the C version and conforms to the internet draft in the
doc/ directory. JNI is used.

Sample applications exist in the Test/ directory.

They generally can be run with something like:

java -debug -classpath
../:/usr/java/lib/classes.zip:/usr/obj/sasl/java/:. jimtest -p 2143 -m
KERBEROS_V4 cyrus-dev

and

java -debug -classpath
../:/usr/java/lib/classes.zip:/usr/obj/sasl/java/:. testserver


Any feedback is welcome.
