To install, run "./configure", then "make".

Note that the library looks for plugins in /usr/lib/sasl, but installs
them into ${prefix}/lib/sasl, where ${prefix} is usually something
like /usr/local.  This is intentional - we want the plugins installed
with the rest of the package (wherever things get installed at your
site), but we want the library to *always* be able to find its plugins
under /usr/lib/sasl, no matter where you install things, so that the
SASL plugin ABI on all platforms is roughly the same.

You'll probably need the GNU make program, available as of this
writing at <url:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make-3.77.tar.gz>.

libsasl can use gdbm or ndbm to implement its user/password lookup.
Most systems come with ndbm these days; as of this writing, gdbm's
available as <url:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdbm-1.7.3.tar.gz>.  This
isn't necessary, but it's useful if you want to use it with a server
which doesn't supply its own authentication database (i.e. most
servers).

For Kerberos support, you'll need the kerberos libraries.  At CMU, the
version we use comes from <url:http://www.pdc.kth.se/kth-krb/>.

For GSSAPI support you will need either MIT Kerberos 5 or the Heimdal
implementation <url:http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal>.

This has been tested under IRIX 6.2, Linux 2.0, and Solaris 2.5.1.
It should work under any platform where dynamic objects can be linked
against other dynamic objects, and where the dynamic library file
extension is ".so".

You may want to play with your CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS a little if you're
using vendor compilers (which we recommend).  We use the following
settings to configure the system on various platforms:

	Solaris: env CC=cc CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure

	IRIX: env CC=cc CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure

	Linux: ./configure
